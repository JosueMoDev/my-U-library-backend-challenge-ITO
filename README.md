# üìö My University Library - ITO Backend Test

A small university library system where students can check out physical books. The system includes roles for both Students and Librarians, allowing them to manage books and users effectively.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Student Role:**
  - View the list of all books in the library
  - Filter or search books by title, author, or genre
  - View details of a selected book and check availability
  - Request a book for checkout if available
  - View a list of all books checked out

- **Librarian Role:**
  - Add new users with first name, last name, email, and role
  - Add new books with title, author, published year, and genre
  - View and manage book checkouts
  - Mark books as returned to update stock

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - TypeScript
  - MongoDB
  - Prisma ORM
  - Swagger for API documentation
  - Class-validator and class-transformer for data validation and transformation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JosueMoDev/my-university-library.git
    cd my-university-library
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Generate Prisma Client:**

    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    ```

# 
4. Rename the .env.template file to .env and configure the following variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=
PORT=
SECRET_KEY_JWT=
```

Note: If you don't have a MongoDB connection string, you can use this test one:
```bash
  DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://test:Su9cJtPRzvwgBOsS@cluster0.wwp35ls.mongodb.net/test
```
5. **Run the seed script:**

    ```bash
    yarn seed
    ```
**Important**: Running the seed script is crucial as it populates the database with initial data required for the application to function correctly. This includes default users, books, and other necessary records to get started.
 ```bash
    {
      "email": "adminuser@gmail.com",
      "password": "my$otrongPass0rd"
    }
 ```
You can log in with this user to start managing the library system right away
6. **Run the development server:**

```bash
    yarn dev
```
